Some useful tools made by the community for the community

## [PTC Account Generator](https://github.com/skvvv/pikapy)
### An automation script that can create any number of Nintendo Pokémon Trainer Club accounts
Used to generate any desired number of PTC accounts - TOS verifies them and includes a google script that can be used to verify all the emails. Outputs generated account information in .csv format.

## [Cor3Zer0's Map Calculator](https://github.com/Cor3Zer0/Map-Calculator)
### Calculator that helps in the creation of PokemonGo Map
Used to calculate optimized flags for particular use cases given a set situation.
_Example: I have an ST of 7, a delay of 10, and need my scan to be around 100 seconds. How many accounts should I use?_

## [HoneySpots - Easy Multi-account-Multi-location generator](https://github.com/razorasadsid/HoneySpots)
### Saves users a ton of tedious work - allows completely customized file generation and control.
Constantly in development - but allows the generation of a multi-worker .bat file with ease, along with custom flags. Can read account and location data right off a .csv file (no need to edit the files either - just set the right columns) and allows you to customize everything from the starting parameters to the naming of each instance through an easily configurable config.ini. 
_Example: I need to search a few small areas very very quickly with accounts I've generated through the_ [PTC Acc Gen](https://github.com/skvvv/pikapy) 
_Example: I have a list of locations and a list of accounts, but I don't want to go through the tedium of having to create the .bat myself_
